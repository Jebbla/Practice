*** Recycle It! ***

*** Description ***
Recycle It is a quick and easy way to locate recycling-facilities near you! The user simply puts in their zipcode, radius limit and material-type.

*** Motivation ***
This game is part of the University of Minnesota's Web Application Development program in which students utilize their newly-found API retrieval abilities. Our team wanted a challenge so we decided to use a minimum of 3 APIs: Earth911, Granim.JS, and Google Earth Engine API. I felt it challenging yet rewarding to create functions capable of "cracking" into the complex databases of Earth911 and Google Maps. 

*** Result ***
The result is an aesthetically simple design that users can use to quickly look up Recycling Facility addresses.

*** Improvements ***
I want to utilize Google Maps API's greater powers such as directions and site-linking abilities.
